# Compilation Suites

This directory specifies all the possible compilation suites available in the
project. For more details, please refer to [the documentation of the compilation
process](https://paradise-fi.github.io/RoFI/intro/compiling.html).

Each suite has a custom readme specifying the dependencies and a reference
Dockerfile. The Dockerfile can be used to compile any suite from the project.
