# The RoFI Platform documentation

This directory contains all the technical documentation for the whole project.
The documentation is generated by [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) (page
generator) and [Breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/) (extraction of in-code
comments). In is written in
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html).

# Dependencies

There are:

- Python dependencies: `sphinx`, `breathe`, `sphinx-rtd-theme`, and `recommonmark`
- system dependencies: `doxygen`, `graphviz`, `inotify-tools`, and `xdg-utils`

You can install them on Debian/Ubuntu by:

```
apt install python3-pip doxygen graphviz inotify-tools xdg-utils
pip3 install sphinx breathe sphinx-rtd-theme recommonmark
```

# Building

To build the doc, just call `make`. Then open `build/html/index.html` in your
browser to see the result.

# Contributing

If you are unsure about reStructuredText see the [this quick
quide](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html). If you
want to add new doxygen source, simply add add it to `breathe_sources` in
`conf.py`. Once you do so, regenerate `Makefile` by calling `python3 conf.py >
Makefile`. To reference Doxygen documentation from your text, see [Breathe
directives](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/directives.html).

Also, to automatically rebuild the sources during the development you can
execute `dev.sh`. It watches documentation for changes and automatically
rebuilds it. It also executes a web server. You can access the documentation on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
