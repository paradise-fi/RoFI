# RoFI - Metamorphic Distributed Robots

Project website: [https://rofi.fi.muni.cz/](https://rofi.fi.muni.cz/)

RoFI is a platform of modular robots developed at [Faculty of Informatics at
Masaryk University](https://fi.muni.cz/). The platform is designed for building
larger robots (RoFIbots) from a small number of module types.

The modules of the platform can connect together using RoFI dock. Mechanically
connected modules can communicate over TCP/IP and share power.

For an in-depth description of the RoFI platform see the [project
website](https://rofi.fi.muni.cz/).

## Repository Structure & Getting Started

If you are interested in building your modules or development of the platform,
please refer to the project documentation:
